/*
 * Imagine a university system where we have a general Faculty class representing a faculty member. 
* We want to create a ScienceFaculty class that inherits from Faculty and adds science-specific attributes.

* This example demonstrates single inheritance in Java, where the ScienceFaculty class 
* inherits from the Faculty class, adding its own specific attributes and behaviors while 
* reusing and extending the functionality of the superclass.
